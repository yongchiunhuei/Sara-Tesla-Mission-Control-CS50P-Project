## Project Overview
**SARA (Sync, Audit, Route, Autonomy)** is a Python-based mission control interface designed for the **Tesla Model 3/Y Long Range** rover. The primary objective of this project is to solve "range anxiety" by performing a real-time Logic-Sync between the vehicle's current State of Charge (SOC) and the intended target destination. 

Unlike standard navigation apps, SARA performs a pre-flight energy audit. If the system detects that the battery levels will fall below a critical 10% safety buffer, it automatically triggers a "Sector Recovery" protocol, harvesting nearby Tesla Supercharger locations from the Google Cloud data-grid and injecting them as mandatory waypoints into the navigation path.

## File Architecture

### 1. `project.py`
This is the heart of the Mission Control. It utilizes four main functional blocks:
- **`get_route_options`**: Connects to the Google Directions API to acquire multiple tactical paths to the destination. It converts raw meter data into kilometers for the energy audit.
- **`audit_mission`**: The mathematical engine. It calculates energy consumption based on a 75kWh battery capacity and a 6.5km/kWh efficiency constant. It returns a boolean "GO/ABORT" status and the predicted arrival SOC.
- **`handle_recharge`**: The emergency protocol. If the audit fails, this function uses the Google Places API and Distance Matrix API to find and rank the three nearest charging targets.
- **`launch_navigation`**: The execution layer. It uses URL encoding to synthesize a final Google Maps link, ensuring all locations and waypoints are "sanitized" for web transmission.

### 2. `test_project.py`
To ensure Magnitude 1,000,000 reliability, this file utilizes the `pytest` framework. It employs "Mocking" techniques to simulate API responses, allowing the system to be audited without consuming live Google Cloud credits or requiring a satellite link. It tests the energy math, the URL generation, and the error-handling logic.

### 3. `requirements.txt`
This file ensures that the `requests` library—our primary link to the Google API ecosystem—is correctly installed in the grading environment.

## Design Choices & Constants
- **Safety Buffer**: A hardcoded 10% reserve was chosen to account for "Vampire Drain" and environmental factors in Aachen, Germany, such as cold weather or high-speed Autobahn travel.
- **API Choice**: The project integrates three distinct Google APIs (Directions, Places, and Distance Matrix) to provide a more holistic data-sync than a single API could offer.
- **Vehicle Profile**: The constants are tuned to the Tesla Model 3/Y Long Range (75kWh usable), providing the most accurate results for the most common rover models in the current ecosystem.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Execute the mission: `python project.py`
3. Enter your departure, destination, and current battery percentage when prompted.
